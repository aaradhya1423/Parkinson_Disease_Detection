# Parkinson_Disease_Detection
Objective: Detect Parkinson’s disease early using voice-based biomedical features and machine learning.

Dataset: Biomedical voice measurements (e.g., UCI Parkinson’s dataset) containing features like:

Fundamental frequency (Fo), jitter, shimmer, HNR, RPDE, DFA, Spread1, Spread2, etc.

Data Analysis:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships.

Use correlation analysis to select important features.

Apply scaling/normalization to prepare data for modeling.

Machine Learning Models:

Train models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, or KNN.

Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Deployment:

The trained model is integrated into a web-based application using Streamlit.

Users can input voice feature values, and the app predicts whether the person likely has Parkinson’s disease.
